# simplificador_expresiones

This is a project of Programming I subject of Universitat PolitÃ©cnica de Catalunya. We carry out "simplificador_expresiones" to learn OOP; linear and arborescents structures as stacks, queues, list and binary trees; and recursive programming.
The project consist in an expression (boolean or numeric) simplifier that user input in prefix, postfix or infix notations, the program simplifies and prints on one of three notations.

If you want to test it, you must enter the following command:

    NOTATION1 expression -> NOTATION2

being NOTATIONX one of the following possibilities: PREFIXA (prefix), POSTFIXA (postfix) or INFIXA (infix).
